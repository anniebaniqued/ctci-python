===========

Writing solutions to all CTCI problems in python.

Chapter 1
---------

1.1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures? [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_1.py)

1.2. Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null terminated string.[Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_2.py)

1.3. Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_3.py)

1.4. Write a method to replace all spaces in a astring with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place).

EXAMPLE

Input : "Mr John Smith    "
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
