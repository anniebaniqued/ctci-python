===========

Writing solutions to all CTCI problems in python.

Chapter 1
---------

1.1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures? [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_1.py)

1.2. Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null terminated string.[Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_2.py)

1.3. Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_3.py)

1.4. Write a method to replace all spaces in a astring with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place).

EXAMPLE

Input : "Mr John Smith    "
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
[Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_4.py)

1.5. Implement a method to perform a basic string compression using the counts of the repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_5.py)

1.6. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? [Solution](https://github.com/maybeiambatman/ctci-python/blob/master/chapter-1/problem_1_6.py)
